1.correctness(A):
After testing, the function of the implementation in the given scope is correct, and some code is considered pythonic.
Maybe method identity()(in 67th line), zeros()(in 83th line) should be static? Using these two methods requires an existing matrix is a bit odd.
2.test(A):
Have doctest in __main__ï¼Œpass all the running tests. 
Have help message in each method.
3.documentation(A):
There are proper comments, but there seems to be a lack of copyright, author, and version information...
4.exception(A):
Use assert and excepthon, maybe have too broad exception clause?(in 31th, 116th, 133th, line of code)
5.pep8(A):
Generally in line with the coding specification, here are some more accurate recommendations for pep8:
	1.For block comments, leave a space after '#': 
		in: 1st line of code.
	2.Try to limit the maximum length of each line to 79 lines, beyond which you can use '\' or parentheses to wrap the line:
		in: 55th, 64th, 80th line of code.
	3.A blank line is required between method definitions in the class:
		in: 12th, 57th line of code.
	4.expected 2 blank lines after class or function definition:
		in: 150th line of code.
	5.missing whitespace after ',':
		in: 3rd, 5th, 13th, 14th, 17th, 25th, 35th, 48th, 67th, 75th, 83th, 90th, 98th, 106th, 119th, 137th line of code.
	6.multiple spaces after 'return':
		in: 56th line of code.
